# braillebyte

Welcome to the **braillebyte**! This is a simple and fun project that encodes and decodes bytes to a Braille-like representation. Please note that this is not a real library for converting text to readable Braille; itâ€™s purely for educational and entertainment purposes.

## Features

- **Encode**: Convert a slice of bytes into a Braille-like string representation.
- **Decode**: Convert a Braille-like string back into the original bytes.


## Usage
### Encode

To encode a byte slice to a Braille string:

```go

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "braillebyte"
)

func main() {
    data := []byte("Hello")
    encoded := braillebyte.Encode(data)
    fmt.Println("Encoded:", encoded)
}
```

### Decode

To decode a Braille string back to bytes:

```go

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "braillebyte"
)

func main() {
    braille := "Encoded Braille String"
    decoded := braillebyte.Decode(braille)
    fmt.Println("Decoded:", string(decoded))
}
```
